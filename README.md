# CoSMO: Consent in Social Media Ontology

CoSMO is an ontology designed for the semantic representation of individuals' consent in digital social media. Based on Brazil’s LGPD and international guidelines, it integrates legal, technical, and cognitive aspects to support privacy solutions, transparency, and user awareness.

## Motivation

The processing of personal data on digital social media platforms requires users to give clear and informed consent. CoSMO provides a semantic framework to model concepts such as consent, data subjects' rights, privacy policies, management mechanisms, and manipulative practices (dark patterns).

## Key Concepts

- **Consent**  
- **Data Controllers and Agents**
- **Personal Data**
- **Data Subject Rights**
- **Policies and Terms**
- **Dark Patterns**

## Structure and Formats

The ontology is implemented in OWL using Protégé. It follows best practices for ontology reuse, integrating FOAF, IAO, and BFO.  
Available files:
- `CoSMO.owl` – main OWL ontology  
- `CoSMO.ttl` – Turtle version
