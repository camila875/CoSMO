# CoSMO
An ontology for representing Consent in Social Media with a view towards LGPD compliance. The LGPD is the Brazilian Data Protection Law (Law No. 13,709 of August 14, 2018), which establishes consent as one of the lawful basis for processing personal data. 

CoSMO aims to provide a representation of processes related to consent provided by the data subject for processing personal data on social media platforms. To achieve this, this ontology integrates key legal components of the LGPD — including its principles and data subject rights — and also considers factors that may influence or impair informed consent, such as dark patterns and cognitive biases or limitations.
